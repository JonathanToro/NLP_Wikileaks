# Analyzing the Podesta emails
## Natural Language Processing project that analyzes the Podesta emails from Wikileaks

The goal of this project is to use natural language processing techniques to analyze the podesta emails. I use topic modelling methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to figure out what is discussed by Hillary Clinton's campaign manager and other important people in the campaign. The workflow is as follows:

1. Scrape the emails from Wikileaks
2. Use LDA to topic model the emails
3. Use gephi to create a network visualization of the campaign
